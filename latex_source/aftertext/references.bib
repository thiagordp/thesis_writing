abstract = {Reinforcement learning offers to robotics a framework and set of tools for the design of sophisticated and hard-to-engineer behaviors. Conversely, the challenges of robotic problems provide both inspiration, impact, and validation for developments in reinforcement learning. The relationship between disciplines has sufficient promise to be likened to that between physics and mathematics. In this article, we attempt to strengthen the links between the two research communities by providing a survey of work in reinforcement learning for behavior generation in robots. We highlight both key challenges in robot reinforcement learning as well as notable successes. We discuss how contributions tamed the complexity of the domain and study the role of algorithms, representations, and prior knowledge in achieving these successes. As a result, a particular focus of our paper lies on the choice between model-based and model-free as well as between value-function-based and policy-search methods. By analyzing a simple problem in some detail we demonstrate how reinforcement learning approaches may be profitably applied, and we note throughout open questions and the tremendous potential for future research. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2013.},

% Predict weather
@article{Shi2015,
abstract = {The goal of precipitation nowcasting is to predict the future rainfall intensity in a local region over a relatively short period of time. Very few previous studies have examined this crucial and challenging weather forecasting problem from the machine learning perspective. In this paper, we formulate precipitation nowcasting as a spatiotemporal sequence forecasting problem in which both the input and the prediction target are spatiotemporal sequences. By extending the fully connected LSTM (FC-LSTM) to have convolutional structures in both the input-to-state and state-to-state transitions, we propose the convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) and use it to build an end-to-end trainable model for the precipitation nowcasting problem. Experiments show that our ConvLSTM network captures spatiotemporal correlations better and consistently outperforms FC-LSTM and the state-of-the-art operational ROVER algorithm for precipitation nowcasting.},

We use Natural Language Processing, particularly the bag-of-words model to represent the case text into n-grams. Spectral clustering is also used to group these n-grams into topics. These n-gram and topic features are then input to the machine learning algorithms such as linear support vector machines and random forest classifiers. Linear support vector machine results reached 45% on the n-gram datasets and 55% on the topic datasets. The best result we obtained is 59% on the topic datasets using a random forest classifier.

@article{Hassan2020,
abstract = {Contract documents are a critical legal component of a construction project that specify all wishes and expectations of the owner toward the design, construction, and handover of a project. Precise comprehension of the contract documents is critical to ensure that all important contractual requirements of the project scope are captured and managed. A contract package typically includes both requirements and other unimportant texts such as instructions and supporting statements; thus, practitioners are required to read and identify texts indicating the requirements. The conventional manual practice of scope comprehension requires much time and effort and may include human errors. Little attention has been paid toward automated identification of requirement texts. This study introduces an effective way to identify contractual requirements by developing an automated framework using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. Four different machine learning algorithms, namely Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes, support vector machines, logistic regression, and feedforward neural network were used to develop the classification models. The models classified the contractual text into requirement and nonrequirement text. Experiments showed that the support vector machine model outperforms the other models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. In addition, unigrams yield better results than higher n-gram features. An experimental study including human participants further proves that the developed model is efficient and effective that can help reduce reading time and improve contract scope comprehension.},

abstract = {Big Data has gained much attention from the academia and the IT industry. In the digital and computing world, information is generated and collected at a rate that rapidly exceeds the boundary range. Currently, over 2 billion people worldwide are connected to the Internet, and over 5 billion individuals own mobile phones. By 2020, 50 billion devices are expected to be connected to the Internet. At this point, predicted data production will be 44 times greater than that in 2009. As information is transferred and shared at light speed on optic fiber and wireless networks, the volume of data and the speed of market growth increase. However, the fast growth rate of such large data generates numerous challenges, such as the rapid growth of data, transfer speed, diverse data, and security. Nonetheless, Big Data is still in its infancy stage, and the domain has not been reviewed in general. Hence, this study comprehensively surveys and classifies the various attributes of Big Data, including its nature, definitions, rapid growth rate, volume, management, analysis, and security. This study also proposes a data life cycle that uses the technologies and terminologies of Big Data. Future research directions in this field are determined based on opportunities and several open issues in Big Data domination. These research directions facilitate the exploration of the domain and the development of optimal techniques to address Big Data.},

abstract = {Different approaches for textual feature extraction have been proposed starting with simple word count features and continuing with deeper representations capturing distributional semantics. In recent publications word embedding methods have been successfully used as a representation basis for a large number of NLP tasks like text classification, part of speech tagging and many others. In this article we explore opportunities of using multiple text representations simultaneously within one regression task in order to exploit conventional bag of words approach with the more semantically rich embeddings. We investigate performance of this multi-representation approach on the financial risk prediction problem. Publicly available 10-K reports filled by US trading companies are used as the basis for predicting next year change in stock price volatility. Our study shows that models based on single representations achieve performance that is comparable to the previously published results on risk prediction and models with multiple representations benefit from complementary information and outperform both baseline and single representation models.},

abstract = {When courts started publishing judgements, big data analysis (i.e. large-scale statistical analysis of case law and machine learning) within the legal domain became possible. By taking data from the European Court of Human Rights as an example, we investigate how natural language processing tools can be used to analyse texts of the court proceedings in order to automatically predict (future) judicial decisions. With an average accuracy of 75\% in predicting the violation of 9 articles of the European Convention on Human Rights our (relatively simple) approach highlights the potential of machine learning approaches in the legal domain. We show, however, that predicting decisions for future cases based on the cases from the past negatively impacts performance (average accuracy range from 58 to 68\%). Furthermore, we demonstrate that we can achieve a relatively high classification performance (average accuracy of 65\%) when predicting outcomes based only on the surnames of the judges that try the case.},

Text similarity calculation has great research value in the field of statistical machine translation. Doc2Vec deep learning algorithm can update the clustering result by comparing text similarity without re-implementing text clustering. This paper will use the civil aviation legal provisions as data samples, use Doc2Vec deep learning algorithm to calculate the similarity between different legal provisions, and apply the method to the classification of legal provisions and the update of text clustering results. The experimental results show that although the method does not achieve the ideal expectation of the similarity between the texts in the same field, it can still classify the text more accurately.},

abstract = {Abstract This article explores the future for lawyers and law firms in the light of the changes that Artificial Intelligence (âAIâ) is already bringing to the universe of legal services. Part I briefly describes some of the ways AI is already in use in ordinary life - from facial recognition, through medical diagnosis to translation services. Part II describes how AI is transforming what it means to provide legal services in six primary areas: litigation review; expertise automation; legal research; contract analytics; contract and litigation document generation; and predictive analytics. Part III explores who are the providers of these AI driven legal services - often non-lawyer legal service providers - and how these providers are replacing at least some of what clients have traditionally sought from lawyers. Part III also discusses the implications of all these changes both for the future role of lawyers individually, and in particular what services will clients still need lawyers to perform: judgment, empathy, creativity and adaptability. In turn, this Part examines what will these changes mean for the size, shape, composition and economic model of law firms, as well as the implications of these changes for legal education and lawyer training. Part IV identifies the principal legal, ethical, regulatory and risk management issues raised by the use of AI in the provision of legal services. Finally, in Part V the article considers who will be the likely providers of AI based services other than law firms: legal publishers, major accounting firms and venture capital funded businesses.},

Artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly permeates every aspect of our society, from the critical, like urban infrastructure, law enforcement, banking, healthcare and humanitarian aid, to the mundane like dating. AI, including embodied AI in robotics and techniques like machine learning, can improve economic, social welfare and the exercise of human rights. Owing to the proliferation of AI in high-risk areas, the pressure is mounting to design and govern AI to be accountable, fair and transparent. How can this be achieved and through which frameworks? This is one of the central questions addressed in this special issue, in which eight authors present in-depth analyses of the ethical, legal-regulatory and technical challenges posed by developing governance regimes for AI systems. It also gives a brief overview of recent developments in AI governance, how much of the agenda for defining AI regulation, ethical frameworks and technical approaches is set, as well as providing some concrete suggestions to further the debate on AI governance.},

@article{Hassan2020,
abstract = {Contract documents are a critical legal component of a construction project that specify all wishes and expectations of the owner toward the design, construction, and handover of a project. Precise comprehension of the contract documents is critical to ensure that all important contractual requirements of the project scope are captured and managed. A contract package typically includes both requirements and other unimportant texts such as instructions and supporting statements; thus, practitioners are required to read and identify texts indicating the requirements. The conventional manual practice of scope comprehension requires much time and effort and may include human errors. Little attention has been paid toward automated identification of requirement texts. This study introduces an effective way to identify contractual requirements by developing an automated framework using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. Four different machine learning algorithms, namely Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes, support vector machines, logistic regression, and feedforward neural network were used to develop the classification models. The models classified the contractual text into requirement and nonrequirement text. Experiments showed that the support vector machine model outperforms the other models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. In addition, unigrams yield better results than higher n-gram features. An experimental study including human participants further proves that the developed model is efficient and effective that can help reduce reading time and improve contract scope comprehension.},

Based on the communication accommodation theory, we examine both the contents of online consumer reviews and managerial responses to analyze what consumers and managers write and the associated linguistic characteristics to determine how they write. We examine and compare online consumer reviews and managerial responses on social media platforms, third-party booking platforms, and direct-sales platforms in four dimensions. These include (a) linguistic characteristics, (b) content, (c) the interaction between consumers and managers, and (d) the mechanism of the reflection of online reviews in consumer satisfaction. We use a text mining approach, latent semantic analysis, and text regressions to analyze data from the hotel industry. The findings suggest that both the linguistic characteristics and content of the consumer reviews and managerial responses differ depending on the platform. However, the factors influencing consumer satisfaction are the same among the three platforms. Consumer reviews on social media platforms have greater subjectivity and length; reviews on direct platforms have higher polarity, diversity, and readability. Consumer reviews focus more on interpersonal and intangible attributes on social media, on economic attributes on third-party platforms, and on tangible attributes on direct platforms. Managersâ responses have similar linguistic styles in terms of subjectivity, polarity, and readability, but they use more words with greater diversity and focus more on operations and facility issues on direct platforms than on the other two platforms. We provide implications for managers to understand consumer reviews and write responses."

abstract = {Reliable estimation of the classification performance of inferred predictive models is difficult when working with small data sets. Cross-validation is in this case a typical strategy for estimating the performance. However, many standard approaches to cross-validation suffer from extensive bias or variance when the area under the ROC curve (AUC) is used as the performance measure. This issue is explored through an extensive simulation study. Leave-pair-out cross-validation is proposed for conditional AUC-estimation, as it is almost unbiased, and its deviation variance is as low as that of the best alternative approaches. When using regularized least-squares based learners, efficient algorithms exist for calculating the leave-pair-out cross-validation estimate. {\textcopyright} 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

@article{ElJelali2015a,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. The perspective of online dispute resolution (ODR) is to develop an online electronic system aimed at solving out-of-court disputes. Among ODR schemes, eMediation is becoming an important tool for encouraging the positive settlement of an agreement among litigants. The main motivation underlying the adoption of eMediation is the time/cost reduction for the resolution of disputes compared to the ordinary justice system. In the context of eMediation, a fundamental requirement that an ODR system should meet relates to both litigants and mediators, i.e. to enable an informed negotiation by informing the parties about the rights and duties related to the case. In order to match this requirement, we propose an information retrieval system able to retrieve relevant court decisions with respect to the disputant case description. The proposed system combines machine learning and natural language processing techniques to better match disputant case descriptions (informal and concise) with court decisions (formal and verbose). Experimental results confirm the ability of the proposed solution to empower court decision retrieval, enabling therefore a well-informed eMediation process.},

abstract = {Recent advances in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning provide us with the tools to build predictive models that can be used to unveil patterns driving judicial decisions. This can be useful, for both lawyers and judges, as an assisting tool to rapidly identify cases and extract patterns which lead to certain decisions. This paper presents the first systematic study on predicting the outcome of cases tried by the European Court of Human Rights based solely on textual content. We formulate a binary classification task where the input of our classifiers is the textual content extracted from a case and the target output is the actual judgment as to whether there has been a violation of an article of the convention of human rights. Textual information is represented using contiguous word sequences, i.e., N-grams, and topics. Our models can predict the court's decisions with a strong accuracy (79\% on average). Our empirical analysis indicates that the formal facts of a case are the most important predictive factor. This is consistent with the theory of legal realism suggesting that judicial decision-making is significantly affected by the stimulus of the facts. We also observe that the topical content of a case is another important feature in this classification task and explore this relationship further by conducting a qualitative analysis.},

abstract = {This paper introduces EfficientNetV2, a new family of convolutional networks that have faster training speed and better parameter efficiency than previous models. To develop this family of models, we use a combination of training-aware neural architecture search and scaling, to jointly optimize training speed and parameter efficiency. The models were searched from the search space enriched with new ops such as Fused-MBConv. Our experiments show that EfficientNetV2 models train much faster than state-of-the-art models while being up to 6.8x smaller. Our training can be further sped up by progressively increasing the image size during training, but it often causes a drop in accuracy. To compensate for this accuracy drop, we propose to adaptively adjust regularization (e.g., dropout and data augmentation) as well, such that we can achieve both fast training and good accuracy. With progressive learning, our EfficientNetV2 significantly outperforms previous models on ImageNet and CIFAR/Cars/Flowers datasets. By pretraining on the same ImageNet21k, our EfficientNetV2 achieves 87.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet ILSVRC2012, outperforming the recent ViT by 2.0% accuracy while training 5x-11x faster using the same computing resources.

As public awareness of the efficacy of DL increases so does the desire to make use of it. But even for highly trained professionals it can be daunting to approach the rapidly increasing body of knowledge in the field. Where does one start? How does one determine if a particular DL model is applicable to their problem? How does one train and deploy them? With these questions in mind, we present an overview of some of the key DL architectures. We also discuss some new automatic architecture optimization protocols that use multi-agent approaches. Further, since guaranteeing system uptime is critical to many applications, a section dwells on using DL for fault detection and mitigation. This is followed by an exploratory survey of several areas where DL emerged as a game-changer: fraud detection in financial applications, financial time-series forecasting, predictive and prescriptive analytics, medical image processing, power systems research and recommender systems. The thrust of this review is to outline emerging applications of DL and provide a reference to researchers seeking to use DL in their work for pattern recognition with unparalleled learning capacity and the ability to scale with data.},

abstract = {How can we perform efficient inference and learning in directed probabilistic models, in the presence of continuous latent variables with intractable posterior distributions, and large datasets? We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions is two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results.},

abstract = {The game of chess is the most widely-studied domain in the history of artificial intelligence. The strongest programs are based on a combination of sophisticated search techniques, domain-specific adaptations, and handcrafted evaluation functions that have been refined by human experts over several decades. In contrast, the AlphaGo Zero program recently achieved superhuman performance in the game of Go, by tabula rasa reinforcement learning from games of self-play. In this paper, we generalise this approach into a single AlphaZero algorithm that can achieve, tabula rasa, superhuman performance in many challenging domains. Starting from random play, and given no domain knowledge except the game rules, AlphaZero achieved within 24 hours a superhuman level of play in the games of chess and shogi (Japanese chess) as well as Go, and convincingly defeated a world-champion program in each case.},

Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework.

LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document modeling, text classification, and collaborative filtering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model.},

abstract = {Large datasets are increasingly common and are often difficult to interpret. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of such datasets, increasing interpretability but at the same time minimizing information loss. It does so by creating new uncorrelated variables that successively maximize variance. Finding such new variables, the principal components, reduces to solving an eigenvalue/eigenvector problem, and the new variables are defined by the dataset at hand, not a priori , hence making PCA an adaptive data analysis technique. It is adaptive in another sense too, since variants of the technique have been developed that are tailored to various different data types and structures. This article will begin by introducing the basic ideas of PCA, discussing what it can and cannot do. It will then describe some variants of PCA and their application.},

abstract = {Overfitting has been widely studied in the context of classification and regression. In this paper, we study the overfitting in the context of dimensionality reduction. We show that the conventional wisdom of improving classification performance by maximising inter-class discrimination is not valid for high-dimensional datasets, and can lead to severe overfitting. In particular, we prove the theoretical existence of perfectly discriminative subspace projections, and show that for datasets with very high input dimensionality, inter-class discrimination should be reduced rather than maximised. This naturally leads to a simple dimensionality reduction technique, which we call Soft Discriminant Maps, which we use to show a direct relationship between the classification performance and the level of inter-class discrimination of feature extractors. Moreover, Soft Discriminant Maps consistently exhibit better classification performance than other comparable techniques.},

Feature selection usually can lead to better learning performance, i.e., higher learning accuracy, lower computational cost, and better model interpretability. Recently, researchers from computer vision, text mining and so on have proposed a variety of feature selection algorithms and in terms of theory and experiment, show the effectiveness of their works. This paper is aimed at reviewing the state of the art on these techniques. Furthermore, a thorough experiment is conducted to check if the use of feature selection can improve the performance of learning, considering some of the approaches mentioned in the literature. The experimental results show that unsupervised feature selection algorithms benefits machine learning tasks improving the performance of clustering.},

@article{Hodge2004,
abstract = {This chapter highlights Ningxia Province, with a largely agriculture-based economy that is undergoing both planned (policy-driven) and autonomous (individual-and household-level) transitions. Environmental degradation, overexploitation of water resources and agricultural intensification make the province's ecosystems particularly vulnerable to harm during droughts and other weather hazards, in turn increasing the vulnerability of the populations that depend upon the land and its ecosystem services to support their livelihoods. Ningxia is one of the most arid regions of China, experiencing serious water resource shortages due to lack of supply availability, inefficient use of water supplies and high demand, with high evapotranspiration rates (Xu et al., 2013). The province's average annual per capita water availability is 687 m3, less than one-third of the national average at an amount categorised as âsevere water shortage' according to World Bank standards (Qiu et al., 2012; see also Chapter 4). Fragile soils, land use changes and multi-year droughts have intensified desertification rates, with degraded areas now accounting for around 44{\%} of provincial land area (Qiu et al., 2012). The types of challenges that Ningxia faces exemplify some aspects of China's larger adaptation challenge. Families in Ningxia that rely on agriculture and livestock raising for their living, like Ma Changjun's, cannot afford to waste a drop of water. His family and those living in Yanchi in Ningxia make their living by growing maize and breeding sheep, and through temporary migration to find work in other places. Many families in rural communities in central and northern parts of the province (Figure 8.1) rely on cisterns to meet drinking water needs, and they ration and recycle water from bathing to wash clothes and water their vegetables and sheep. Despite this, there is not enough water in some years, Ma says in a 2012 interview. Drought, declines in rainfall over the past two decades and overgrazing that damages the land are stressing these families' abilities to survive. The types of issues facing Ningxia's families â land use and water resource management, transitioning socio-economic conditions, pollution issues and migration â are emblematic of the types of issues facing families in other provinces in China, particularly rural families. Many rural provinces, including Ningxia, have greater proportions of ethnic groups who have different cultures, traditional livelihoods and relationships with the land â in effect marking multiple Chinas. These identities and socio-cultural values are shifting in response to wider environmental, policy and economic pressures, as discussed in Chapter 2. Climate change is an additional pressure placed upon the inhabitants of Ningxia, and altering their climate risks.},

abstract = {Most existing model-based approaches to anomaly detection construct a profile of normal instances, then identify instances that do not conform to the normal profile as anomalies. This paper proposes a fundamentally different model-based method that explicitly isolates anomalies instead of profiles normal points. To our best knowledge, the concept of isolation has not been explored in current literature. The use of isolation enables the proposed method, iForest, to exploit sub-sampling to an extent that is not feasible in existing methods, creating an algorithm which has a linear time complexity with a low constant and a low memory requirement. Our empirical evaluation shows that iForest performs favourably to ORCA, a near-linear time complexity distance-based method, LOF and Random Forests in terms of AUC and processing time, and especially in large data sets. iForest also works well in high dimensional problems which have a large number of irrelevant attributes, and in situations where training set does not contain any anomalies. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {In recent years, deep artificial neural networks (including recurrent ones) have won numerous contests in pattern recognition and machine learning. This historical survey compactly summarizes relevant work, much of it from the previous millennium. Shallow and Deep Learners are distinguished by the depth of their credit assignment paths, which are chains of possibly learnable, causal links between actions and effects. I review deep supervised learning (also recapitulating the history of backpropagation), unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning & evolutionary computation, and indirect search for short programs encoding deep and large networks.}
