abstract = {Reinforcement learning offers to robotics a framework and set of tools for the design of sophisticated and hard-to-engineer behaviors. Conversely, the challenges of robotic problems provide both inspiration, impact, and validation for developments in reinforcement learning. The relationship between disciplines has sufficient promise to be likened to that between physics and mathematics. In this article, we attempt to strengthen the links between the two research communities by providing a survey of work in reinforcement learning for behavior generation in robots. We highlight both key challenges in robot reinforcement learning as well as notable successes. We discuss how contributions tamed the complexity of the domain and study the role of algorithms, representations, and prior knowledge in achieving these successes. As a result, a particular focus of our paper lies on the choice between model-based and model-free as well as between value-function-based and policy-search methods. By analyzing a simple problem in some detail we demonstrate how reinforcement learning approaches may be profitably applied, and we note throughout open questions and the tremendous potential for future research. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2013.},

% Predict weather
@article{Shi2015,
abstract = {The goal of precipitation nowcasting is to predict the future rainfall intensity in a local region over a relatively short period of time. Very few previous studies have examined this crucial and challenging weather forecasting problem from the machine learning perspective. In this paper, we formulate precipitation nowcasting as a spatiotemporal sequence forecasting problem in which both the input and the prediction target are spatiotemporal sequences. By extending the fully connected LSTM (FC-LSTM) to have convolutional structures in both the input-to-state and state-to-state transitions, we propose the convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) and use it to build an end-to-end trainable model for the precipitation nowcasting problem. Experiments show that our ConvLSTM network captures spatiotemporal correlations better and consistently outperforms FC-LSTM and the state-of-the-art operational ROVER algorithm for precipitation nowcasting.},

@article{Caruana1997,
abstract = {Multitask Learning is an approach to inductive transfer that improves generalization by using the domain information contained in the training signals of related tasks as an inductive bias. It does this by learning tasks in parallel while using a shared representation; what is learned for each task can help other tasks be learned better. This paper reviews prior work on MTL, presents new evidence that MTL in backprop nets discovers task relatedness without the need of supervisory signals, and presents new results for MTL with k-nearest neighbor and kernel regression. In this paper we demonstrate multitask learning in three domains. We explain how multitask learning works, and show that there are many opportunities for multitask learning in real domains. We present an algorithm and results for multitask learning with case-based methods like k-nearest neighbor and kernel regression, and sketch an algorithm for multitask learning in decision trees. Because multitask learning works, can be applied to many different kinds of domains, and can be used with different learning algorithms, we conjecture there will be many opportunities for its use on real-world problems.},

This study aims to provide a solution to alleviate these problems by predicting the outcome of court cases. As the Philippine Supreme Court case decisions are the only readily available data online, we use this as our dataset. We use Natural Language Processing, particularly the bag-of-words model to represent the case text into n-grams. Spectral clustering is also used to group these n-grams into topics. These n-gram and topic features are then input to the machine learning algorithms such as linear support vector machines and random forest classifiers. Linear support vector machine results reached 45% on the n-gram datasets and 55% on the topic datasets. The best result we obtained is 59% on the topic datasets using a random forest classifier.

@article{Hassan2020,
abstract = {Contract documents are a critical legal component of a construction project that specify all wishes and expectations of the owner toward the design, construction, and handover of a project. Precise comprehension of the contract documents is critical to ensure that all important contractual requirements of the project scope are captured and managed. A contract package typically includes both requirements and other unimportant texts such as instructions and supporting statements; thus, practitioners are required to read and identify texts indicating the requirements. The conventional manual practice of scope comprehension requires much time and effort and may include human errors. Little attention has been paid toward automated identification of requirement texts. This study introduces an effective way to identify contractual requirements by developing an automated framework using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. Four different machine learning algorithms, namely Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes, support vector machines, logistic regression, and feedforward neural network were used to develop the classification models. The models classified the contractual text into requirement and nonrequirement text. Experiments showed that the support vector machine model outperforms the other models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. In addition, unigrams yield better results than higher n-gram features. An experimental study including human participants further proves that the developed model is efficient and effective that can help reduce reading time and improve contract scope comprehension.},

In the digital and computing world, information is generated and collected at a rate that rapidly exceeds the boundary range. Currently, over 2 billion people worldwide are connected to the Internet, and over 5 billion individuals own mobile phones. By 2020, 50 billion devices are expected to be connected to the Internet. At this point, predicted data production will be 44 times greater than that in 2009. As information is transferred and shared at light speed on optic fiber and wireless networks, the volume of data and the speed of market growth increase. However, the fast growth rate of such large data generates numerous challenges, such as the rapid growth of data, transfer speed, diverse data, and security. Nonetheless, Big Data is still in its infancy stage, and the domain has not been reviewed in general. Hence, this study comprehensively surveys and classifies the various attributes of Big Data, including its nature, definitions, rapid growth rate, volume, management, analysis, and security. This study also proposes a data life cycle that uses the technologies and terminologies of Big Data. Future research directions in this field are determined based on opportunities and several open issues in Big Data domination. These research directions facilitate the exploration of the domain and the development of optimal techniques to address Big Data.},

In this article we explore opportunities of using multiple text representations simultaneously within one regression task in order to exploit conventional bag of words approach with the more semantically rich embeddings. We investigate performance of this multi-representation approach on the financial risk prediction problem. Publicly available 10-K reports filled by US trading companies are used as the basis for predicting next year change in stock price volatility. Our study shows that models based on single representations achieve performance that is comparable to the previously published results on risk prediction and models with multiple representations benefit from complementary information and outperform both baseline and single representation models.},

With an average accuracy of 75% in predicting the violation of 9 articles of the European Convention on Human Rights our (relatively simple) approach highlights the potential of machine learning approaches in the legal domain. We show, however, that predicting decisions for future cases based on the cases from the past negatively impacts performance (average accuracy range from 58 to 68%).

Text similarity calculation has great research value in the field of statistical machine translation. Doc2Vec deep learning algorithm can update the clustering result by comparing text similarity without re-implementing text clustering. This paper will use the civil aviation legal provisions as data samples, use Doc2Vec deep learning algorithm to calculate the similarity between different legal provisions, and apply the method to the classification of legal provisions and the update of text clustering results. The experimental results show that although the method does not achieve the ideal expectation of the similarity between the texts in the same field, it can still classify the text more accurately.},

These cases need to be analyzed in order to be associated to relevant tags and allocated to the right team. Most of the cases reach the court as raster scanned documents with widely variable levels of quality. One of the first steps for the analysis is to classify these documents. In this paper we present a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network (Bi-LSTM) to classify these pieces of legal document.},

abstract = {Deep Learning has been widely used for tackling challenging natural language processing tasks over the recent years. Similarly, the application of Deep Neural Networks in legal analytics has increased significantly. In this survey, we study the early adaptation of Deep Learning in legal analytics focusing on three main fields; text classification, information extraction, and information retrieval. We focus on the semantic feature representations, a key instrument for the successful application of deep learning in natural language processing. Additionally, we share pre-trained legal word embeddings using the word2vec model over large corpora, comprised legislations from UK, EU, Canada, Australia, USA, and Japan among others.},

@article{Davis2020,
abstract = {Abstract This article explores the future for lawyers and law firms in the light of the changes that Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) is already bringing to the universe of legal services. Part I briefly describes some of the ways AI is already in use in ordinary life - from facial recognition, through medical diagnosis to translation services. Part II describes how AI is transforming what it means to provide legal services in six primary areas: litigation review; expertise automation; legal research; contract analytics; contract and litigation document generation; and predictive analytics. Part III explores who are the providers of these AI driven legal services - often non-lawyer legal service providers - and how these providers are replacing at least some of what clients have traditionally sought from lawyers. Part III also discusses the implications of all these changes both for the future role of lawyers individually, and in particular what services will clients still need lawyers to perform: judgment, empathy, creativity and adaptability. In turn, this Part examines what will these changes mean for the size, shape, composition and economic model of law firms, as well as the implications of these changes for legal education and lawyer training. Part IV identifies the principal legal, ethical, regulatory and risk management issues raised by the use of AI in the provision of legal services. Finally, in Part V the article considers who will be the likely providers of AI based services other than law firms: legal publishers, major accounting firms and venture capital funded businesses.},

@article{Cath2018,
abstract = {This paper is the introduction to the special issue entitled: ‘Governing artificial intelligence: ethical, legal and technical opportunities and challenges'. Artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly permeates every aspect of our society, from the critical, like urban infrastructure, law enforcement, banking, healthcare and humanitarian aid, to the mundane like dating. AI, including embodied AI in robotics and techniques like machine learning, can improve economic, social welfare and the exercise of human rights. Owing to the proliferation of AI in high-risk areas, the pressure is mounting to design and govern AI to be accountable, fair and transparent. How can this be achieved and through which frameworks? This is one of the central questions addressed in this special issue, in which eight authors present in-depth analyses of the ethical, legal-regulatory and technical challenges posed by developing governance regimes for AI systems. It also gives a brief overview of recent developments in AI governance, how much of the agenda for defining AI regulation, ethical frameworks and technical approaches is set, as well as providing some concrete suggestions to further the debate on AI governance.},

The quality of these representations is measured in a word similarity task, and the results are compared to the previously best performing techniques based on different types of neural networks. We observe large improvements in accuracy at much lower computational cost, i.e. it takes less than a day to learn high quality word vectors from a 1.6 billion words data set. Furthermore, we show that these vectors provide state-of-the-art performance on our test set for measuring syntactic and semantic word similarities.},
